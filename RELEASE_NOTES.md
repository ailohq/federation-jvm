# Release notes

## v0.9.0

* Update protobuf-java to 3.19.4 ([#141](https://github.com/apollographql/federation-jvm/issues/141))
* Add support for `graphql-java` `GraphQLContext`  ([#138](https://github.com/apollographql/federation-jvm/pull/138)). Many thanks to @dariuszuc for the awesome contribution ðŸ’™

## v0.8.0

This release adds support for the @CacheControl directive in the form of a graphql-java instrumentation class, matching the behavior of the apollo-server's built-in cache control plugin. ([#133](https://github.com/apollographql/federation-jvm/pull/133))

## v0.7.0

This is an upgrade release for graphql-java v17. This release is incompatible with earlier graphql-java versions due to backwards-incompatible changes in their `SchemaPrinter`.

*Upgrades:*
- graphql-java to `17.3`.

## v0.6.5

*Enhancements:*
- Split out the `HTTPRequestHeaders` interface into its own artifact `federation-graphql-java-support-api`. This allows third-party libraries to have their context implement this interface without pulling in all the dependencies of `federation-graphql-java-support`.
- Allow providing a function to `FederatedTracingInstrumentation.Options` to decide whether to enable tracing based on the `ExecutionInput` and its context. This is useful if a third-party library does not wish to implement `HTTPRequestHeaders`.

## v0.6.4

*Upgrades:*
- Spring Boot libraries to `2.3.6.RELEASE`.
- GraphQL Java Kickstart libraries to `11.0.0`.

*Enhancements:*
- Add a GraphQL Java Tools microservice example.

## v0.6.3

This release marks the switch of our package hosting from JCenter to Maven Central, as JCenter will be shutting down over the course of the next year. This release contains no code changes, and is primarily to support users who wish to remove any dependencies on JCenter.

## v0.6.2

*Bugfixes:*
- Fix bug where the `@key` directive is not marked repeatable, which results in API call failures due to new assertions introduced in graphql-java v16.

## v0.6.1

*Bugfixes:*
- Fix bug where `Federation.transform()` would remove all query type fields from a schema with query type extensions but an empty query type.

## v0.6.0

This is an upgrade release for graphql-java v16. This release is incompatible with earlier graphql-java versions due to backwards-incompatible changes in their API.

Note that if your schema has an empty query type/no query type and you pass a `GraphQLSchema` object to this library, your `GraphQLSchema` will no longer build in graphql-java v16 due to a new validation. To work around this, you can add a dummy field to your `GraphQLSchema`'s query type, and then pass `queryTypeShouldBeEmpty` as `true` to `Federation.transform()`. The output schema won't contain the dummy field, nor will it be visible to the gateway. If you instead pass a different representation of a schema to `Federation.transform()` (e.g. a string), you don't have to do anything; this library will handle the issue internally.

*Upgrades:*
- graphql-java to `16.1`.

## v0.5.0

This is an upgrade release for graphql-java v15. This release is incompatible with earlier graphql-java versions due to backwards-incompatible changes in their `SchemaPrinter`.

*Upgrades:*
- graphql-java to `15.0`.

## v0.4.3

*Bugfixes:*
- Fix crash in federated tracing support when an error with a null location is thrown.

## v0.4.2

*Bugfixes:*
- Backport bugfix in graphql-java v15's `SchemaPrinter` regarding escaping in single-quoted descriptions to `FederationSdlPrinter`.

## v0.4.1

*Bugfixes:*
- Update `@extends` definition to include interfaces, as per GraphQL spec

## v0.4.0

This is an upgrade release for graphql-java v14. This release is incompatible with earlier graphql-java versions due to breaking changes in their API.

*Upgrades:*
- graphql-java to `14.0`.

## v0.3.4

*Bugfixes:*
- Remove bad description text in `_FieldSet.type`.
- Remove federation directive definitions and type definitions from `query { _service { sdl } }`.

*Enhancements:*
- Enforce that directives used in a `TypeDefinitionRegistry` have a definition and are valid according to that definition.
- Automatically add federation directive definitions and type definitions to `TypeDefinitionRegistry` if it doesn't already have them.

## v0.3.3

This release requires graphql-java v13, due to the backport below.

*Bugfixes:*
- Fix thread-safety bug in federated tracing support.
- Backport bugfix in graphql-java's `SchemaPrinter` to graphql-java v13.

## v0.3.2

*Bugfixes:*
- Fix crash in federated tracing support (new in v0.3.1) when an error with a null message is thrown.

## v0.3.1

*Enhancements:*
- Federated tracing support.

## v0.3.0

Accidental release with no changes.

## v0.2.0

*Bugfixes:*
- When an interface is `@key`ed, its concrete types are added to `_Entity`.

*Enhancements:*
- Range of signatures for `Federation.transform`
- Declaring the query root type in the original schema is optional.

*Upgrades:*
- spring-boot to `2.1.6.RELEASE`.

## v0.1.0

First version tested against the federated Apollo gateway.
